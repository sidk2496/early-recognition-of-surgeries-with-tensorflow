# Early Recognition of Surgeries with Tensorflow

This repository is a sample of the code used to implement the baselines of the paper ['Future-State Predicting LSTM for Early Surgery Type Recognition'.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11727)
It contains the basic functionality for building input pipelines, training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and testing them.
